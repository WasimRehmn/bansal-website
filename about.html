          <p>He had a

            the trade. </p>
          <p>His first stop was Mechanical engineering, where he dwelled
            deep into the subject and came out on the other side as a Hardcore
            Production Personnel at UP Organics Ltd.</p>
          <p>Having said that, he never let
            his hardworking nature come in the way of his dreams. </p>
          <p>Having been an

    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Chasing his dreams since 1996, Vikas spent the first 22 years struggling
      to just get a glimpse of his hero. Little did he know, there would come
      a point in his life when Mr. Bachchan himself would call and greet Vikas
      on stage to read out various poems written by him on varied cultural
      platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a dream to create a legacy of his own, Vikas Bansal stepped out as
      a Mechanical Engineer handling production at UP Organics Ltd. It was in
      the year 1998 when he ventured into Marketing and started to build a
      business plan for his 'idea'. Who was to guess that this career choice
      was going to bring him closer to his future business partner, who would
      also turn out to be his best friend.

        The people who make history are the ones who not only give their life to their career but also give
        their career
        a new life. When the career is that of a poet, every step is a risk. Vikas Bansal is one such poet who has
        gifted
        himself an era of such a popularity which other poets cant’t even dream of. It has been possible only because he
        possesses the courage, wit and perseverance required to tame one’s destiny. The beginning of his poetic career
        was
        nothing short of a blind aim. He did all this to dedicate himself entirely to literature and rest is history.
      </p>

      <p class="read-more-target">
        It
        has been more than a decade of his professional life as a poet and his charm is only increasing with each
        passing
        second. His most celebrated couplet for Amitabh bachchan "102 knock out" made him the heartthrob of the youth
        and
        established him as the most renowned and celebrated Indian poet. His grip over poems written for Amitabh,
        flavoured with his wit makes him stand apart but is not merely confined to it. The treasures that his pen has
        yielded cover wide range of notions viz., social issues, atrocities against women and women empowerment,
        philosophies of life and also those brimming with patriotic fervor. Collectively speaking, his poems are a
        mirror
        to society. Few of his poems has also been recorded as songs encapsulated in Amitabh Bachchan movies and albums.
        He has broken the stereotypes and has not merely confined himself to writing poems and stage shows. He is also
        active in social media, constantly writing and commenting on the happenings in the society. His achievements
        make
        him incredible and he stands unrivalled since years. Hindi literature owes a lot to him for writing a new saga
        in
        the field of poetry.
